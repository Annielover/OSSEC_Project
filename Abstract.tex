In this paper, a literature study is performed about the theoretical fundamentals of intrusion detection systems. Different intrusion detection systems are listed and compared and based on this outcome, Snort has been picked to perform an in-depth analysis, testing and configuration. \\ \\
First, the architecture of Snort is analysed, after which various penetration tests on a test network are executed and based on how Snort reacted on those tests, configuration is performed. \\ \\
As it turns out, Snort performs not so bad out-of-the-box, but additional configuration and fine-tuning is required to make it a fully functioning and viable network intrusion detection system.
